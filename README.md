Rincon is a cloud-native service registry written in [Go](https://go.dev/). 
It is designed to be fast, lightweight, and highly scalable.
Rincon is also platform-agnostic, and can run in the cloud, a container, or even on bare-metal,
making it perfect for both local development and production environments.

Rincon makes it easy for services to register themselves and to discover other services.
Built-in support for health checking and load balancing allows monitoring service status and prevents routing to unavailable services.
External services such as SaaS vendors can also be registered to create a unified discovery interface.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Rincon is to use the official Docker image.
You can pull it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bk1031/rincon).

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 10311:10311 bk1031/rincon:latest
```

Alternatively if you have an existing compose file, you can add Rincon as a service.
This way you can easily connect Rincon to your existing database.

```yml
rincon:
    image: bk1031/rincon:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PORT: "10311"
      STORAGE_MODE: "sql"
      DB_DRIVER: "postgres"
      DB_HOST: "localhost"
      DB_PORT: "5432"
      DB_NAME: "rincon"
      DB_USER: "postgres"
      DB_PASSWORD: "password"
    ports:
      - "10311:10311"
```

By default Rincon will run on port `10311`. Once Rincon is running, we can connect to it from our application using the default username and password `admin`. Let's register a service called `Service A`.

```
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:10311/rincon/services" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -u 'admin:admin' \
     -d $'{
  "endpoint": "localhost:8080",
  "name": "Service A",
  "health_check": "localhost:8080/health",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}'
```

The response body will contain an ID for our newly registered service. Including this ID in future requests will allow you to update the service's registration. Now we can register a route that `Service A` will handle.

```
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:10311/rincon/routes" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -u 'admin:admin' \
     -d $'{
  "route": "/service",
  "service_name": "Service A",
  "method": "*"
}'
```

Now we can verify that our service and route are properly registered by making a request to the route matching endpoint.

```
curl "http://localhost:10311/rincon/match?route=service&method=GET"
```

You should see the service registration for `Service A` returned in the response body. We have now successfully registered a service and route!

## Services

Services are the core of Rincon. They represent instances of a specific application that you want to enable discovery of. Each service has the following properties:

- `id`: The unique identifier for the service.
- `name`: The name of the service.
- `version`: The version of the service.
- `endpoint`: The endpoint of the service.
- `health_check`: The health check endpoint of the service.

When you register a service, you must provide the name, version, endpoint, and health check endpoint. Upon registration, Rincon will return the following Service object.

```json
{
  "id": 820522,
  "name": "rincon",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:10311",
  "health_check": "http://localhost:10311/rincon/ping",
  "updated_at": "2024-08-04T19:32:40.109239344-07:00",
  "created_at": "2024-08-04T19:32:40.109239386-07:00"
}
```

The `id` field is an auto-generated integer with the length specified by the `SERVICE_ID_LENGTH` configuration option. It is a unique identifier for a specific instance of a service. Instances are tied to a service by the `name` field. Note that the service name will be converted to lower-snakecase. The `endpoint` must also be unique across all service instances. When updating an existing service, the `endpoint` will be used as the primary identifier.

### Example

Say we register a service `New York` with the following definition:

`[POST] http://localhost:10311/rincon/services`

```json
{
  "name": "New York",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000",
  "health_check": "http://localhost:3000/ping",
}
```

Rincon will return the following service object to us:
```json
{
  "id": 820522,
  "name": "new_york",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000",
  "health_check": "http://localhost:3000/ping",
  "updated_at": "2024-08-04T19:32:40.109239344-07:00",
  "created_at": "2024-08-04T19:32:40.109239386-07:00"
}
```

Any more services that we register using `New York` (will be converted to `new_york`) as the `name` will be considered another instance of the `New York` service.

## Health Checking

Rincon supports health-checking to ensure that registered services are available through heartbeats. Any services determined to be unhealthy will be removed from the registry and no longer discoverable by other services.

### Server Heartbeats

This is the default heartbeat mode, where Rincon will ping each service's `health_check` endpoint at an interval defined by `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`.
Any `2xx` status code will mark the heartbeat as successful. Any other response will mark the heartbeat as failed, resulting in the service being removed from the registry.

### Client Heartbeats

When operating in client heartbeat mode, Rincon expects pings from the registered services at least once every heartbeat interval. This ping should be made to the service registration endpoint, with all the service fields correctly populated. The ping can be cofirmed by ensuring the `updated_at` field in the response has increased. At each heartbeat interval, Rincon will remove all services with an `updated_at` timestamp older than the interval.

## Routing

Services register routes to tell Rincon what requests they can handle. Each route has the following properties:

- `id`: The unique identifier for the route.
- `route`: The actual route path.
- `method`: The http methods associated with the route.
- `service_name`: The service associated with the route.

When registering a route, you must provide the route, method, and service associated with that route. Upon registration, Rincon will return the following Route object.

```json
{
  "id": "/rincon/ping-[*]",
  "route": "/rincon/ping",
  "method": "*",
  "service_name": "rincon",
  "created_at": "2024-08-04T01:05:37.262645179-07:00"
}
```

The `id` is a generated field in the format `route-[method]`. Note that routes are tied to services, not any specific instance of a service. So if we register 10 routes to the `new_york` service and then spin up 2 more instances of the `new_york` service, all instances of the `new_york` service are considered able to handle those 10 routes.

### Supported Methods

Rincon currently supports the following HTTP Methods:
- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `DELETE`
- `PATCH`
- `OPTIONS`
- `HEAD`
- `*` (wilcard, route can handle all methods)

### Wildcard Routes

Dynamic routing is supported through the use of wildcards, enabling services to handle variable path segments efficiently.

#### `/*` - Any Wildcard

This wildcard can be used to allow any string to match to a certain path segment.

```
/users/*
---
/users/123
/users/abc
```

You can also use this wildcard in the middle of your route.

```
/users/*/profile
---
/users/123/profile
/users/abc/profile
```

#### `/**` - All Wildcard

This wildcard can be used to allow any string to match to all remaining path segments.

```
/users/**
---
/users/123
/users/abc/edit
/users/a1b2c3/account/settings
```

You can even use both wildcards for more specific routing.

```
/users/*/profile/**
---
/users/123/profile/edit
/users/abc/profile/settings/notifications
```

> [!WARNING]
> While you can have the all wildcard (`**`) in the middle of a route path, when the route graph is computed all proceeding segments are ignored.
> ```
> /users/**/profile
> ---
> /users/123
> /users/abc/profile
> /users/a1b2c3/profile/edit
> ```

### Stacking Routes

Routes with the same path and service name will automatically be "stacked". This just means that their methods will be combined into one registration in Rincon.

```c
New York: /users [GET]
New York: /users [POST]
---
New York: /users [GET,POST]
```

If the existing or new route method is `*`, then the stacked method will simply be the wildcard method.

```c
New York: /users [*]
New York: /users [POST]
---
New York: /users [*]
```

### Conflicting Route Registrations

By default, `OVERWRITE_ROUTES` is set to `false`. This means that if you attempt to register a route that has a conflict with an existing route, it will be rejected. Usually these conflicts arise from two routes attached to different services having an overlap in their methods.

```c
New York: /users [GET]
San Francisco: /users [GET] // cannot be registered
```

Even if the newer route has a higher method coverage than the existing route, the registration will be rejected as long as `OVERWRITE_ROUTES` is set to `false`.

```c
New York: /users [GET]
San Francisco: /users [GET,POST] // cannot be registered
```

To ensure that your routes are registered successfully, make sure there are no method overlaps.

```c
New York: /users [GET]
San Francisco: /users [POST,PUT] // no conflict, will be registered successfully!
```

### Overwriting Routes

When `OVERWRITE_ROUTES` is set to `true`, any conflicting registrations will not be rejected. Instead the new registration will replace the existing one.

```c
New York: /users [GET]
San Francisco: /users [GET]
---
San Francisco: /users [GET]
```

If there are multiple conflicting routes, they will all be replaced.

```c
New York: /users [GET]
Boston: /users [POST]
Los Angelos /users [DELETE]
San Francisco: /users [GET,POST,DELETE]
---
San Francisco: /users [GET,POST,DELETE]
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Existing routes will be replaced even if they have a higher route coverage than the new route. Be careful when overwriting routes!
> ```c
> New York: /users [GET,POST]
> San Francisco: /users [GET]
> ---
> San Francisco: /users [GET] // route for New York was completely removed!
> ```

### Route Matching

Internally, Rincon computes a route graph to help it match a requested route against its registered routes. This is a simple directed acyclic graph where nodes are route paths and edges are slugs needed to get to the next route path. Nodes also contain information about which services and methods can be handled at that route path.

As an example, let's say we have the following route registrations.

```
New York: /users
New York: /users/*
San Francisco: /users/stats
San Francsico: /users/*/notifications
Los Angeles: /orgs/stats
Santa Barbara: /orgs/**
```

The generated route graph would look something like the following.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/assets/route-graph-dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/assets/route-graph-light.png">
  <img alt="Rincon Route Graph" src="/assets/route-graph-light.png">
</picture>

When `ENV` is set to `DEV`, the route graph will be printed on each match route request.

```

### Example

Using our `New York` service from the previous example, let's register the following route.

`[POST] http://localhost:10311/rincon/routes`

```json
{
  "route": "/users",
  "method": "*",
  "service_name": "New York",
  }
```

Rincon will return the following route object to us.

```json
{
  "id": "/users-[*]",
  "route": "/users",
  "method": "*",
  "service_name": "new_york",
  "created_at": "2024-08-27T14:04:43.688527-07:00"
}
```

Now we can confirm our route was correctly registered by making a request to the route matching endpoint.

`[GET] http://localhost:10311/rincon/match?route=users&method=GET`

```json
{
  "id": 416156,
  "name": "new_york",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000",
  "health_check": "http://localhost:3000/health",
  "updated_at": "2024-08-27T14:04:23.172214-07:00",
  "created_at": "2024-08-27T14:04:23.172214-07:00"
}
```

As expected, Rincon returned our `New York` service definition. Now let's try to register a route for a different service (assume that `San Francisco` is a service that has already been registered with Rincon).

`[POST] http://localhost:10311/rincon/routes`

```json
{
  "route": "/users",
  "method": "POST",
  "service_name": "San Francisco",
}
```

This time, we get the following error from Rincon.

```json
{
  "message": "route with id /users-[POST] overlaps with existing routes [[*] /users (new_york)]"
}
```

This is because `New York` was already registered to handle all methods (based on the `*` wildcard method definition) on the `/users` route. By default a new service cannot register a route with a conflicting method. This can be changed by setting `OVERWRITE_ROUTES`.

## Load Balancing

Rincon is able to load balance between multiple instances of the same service based on the service name. Currently only random selection is supported (see [`RandomSelector`](/service/balancer.go#L20)).

If clients want to implement their own form of load balancing, they can simply request all the registrations for the service name that was returned from their original match route request.

## Configuration

Here are all the environment variables and their defaults to configure Rincon.

#### `ENV`
***Default:** `PROD`*

Sets whether Rincon should be running in production or development mode.

#### `PORT`
***Default:** `10311`*

The port that the Rincon API binds to.

#### `SELF_ENDPOINT`
***Default:** `http://localhost:{PORT}`*

The endpoint that the Rincon API is accessible at. Rincon uses this value for its initial self-registration.

#### `SELF_HEALTH_CHECK`
***Default:** `http://localhost:{PORT}/rincon/ping`*

The endpoint that the Rincon API's health check is accessible at. Rincon uses this value for its initial self-registration.

#### `AUTH_USER`
***Default:** `admin`*

The username Rincon looks for as part of basic authentication in the `Authorization` headers of incoming requests.

#### `AUTH_PASSWORD`
***Default:** `admin`*

The password Rincon looks for as part of basic authentication in the `Authorization` headers of incoming requests.

#### `SERVICE_ID_LENGTH`
***Default:** `6`*

The length of the auto-generated service IDs. Note that this value must be at least 4.

#### `STORAGE_MODE`
***Default:** `local`*

This sets where Rincon stores all its registration info. Must be either `local` or `sql`. Support for Redis coming soon!

#### `OVERWRITE_ROUTES`
***Default:** `false`*

This flag determines whether Rincon will overwrite existing routes when a new registration arrives from a different service than the existing route. See the Conflicting Route Registration section for more information.

#### `HEARTBEAT_TYPE`
***Default:** `server`*

This determines whether Rincon will ping registered services or expect the services to ping Rincon. Must be set to either `server` or `client`.

#### `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`
***Default:** `10`*

The time between hearbeat pings sent by Rincon. If `HEARTBEAT_TYPE` is set to `client`, then this determines how long after a ping that Rincon considers that service inactive.

#### `HEARTBEAT_RETRY_COUNT`
***Default:** `3`*

The number of retry attempts Rincon will make when a heartbeat ping fails before removing a service from the registry. This is useful for services that may take some time to become ready after registration. Only applies when `HEARTBEAT_TYPE` is set to `server`.

#### `HEARTBEAT_RETRY_BACKOFF`
***Default:** `1000`*

The backoff duration in milliseconds between heartbeat retry attempts. This allows services time to recover before the next retry. Only applies when `HEARTBEAT_TYPE` is set to `server`.

#### `DB_DRIVER`
No default value. Which database engine to use when `STORAGE_MODE` is set to `sql`. Must be either `mysql` or `postgres`.

#### `DB_HOST`
No default value. Database hostname when `STORAGE_MODE` is set to `sql`.

#### `DB_PORT`
No default value. Database port when `STORAGE_MODE` is set to `sql`.

#### `DB_NAME`
No default value. Database name when `STORAGE_MODE` is set to `sql`.

#### `DB_USER`
No default value. Database user when `STORAGE_MODE` is set to `sql`.

#### `DB_PASSWORD`
No default value. Database password when `STORAGE_MODE` is set to `sql`.

#### `DB_TABLE_PREFIX`
***Default:** `rin_`*

The table name prefix that Rincon uses when creating tables, handy in case of existing table conflicts.
